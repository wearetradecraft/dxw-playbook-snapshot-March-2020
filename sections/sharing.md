## Sharing

### Events

We all go to work-related events and conferences, sometimes for work and
sometimes in our personal time. No matter what capacity you're attending an
event in, you are a representative of dxw. What you say and do will influence
the way people think about the company as well as about you. It's important,
both personally and for the business, that you make a positive impression.

This section is here to share what we've learned about how to make the most of
these sorts of events.

* **Be nice**: this should go without saying, but whenever we're at events, we show respect to others, treating them how we would like to be treated. If you meet and talk to others and you’re pleasant, welcoming, and interested in what they have to say you’ll always be remembered in a positive light.
* **Talk to people**: one of the best parts of this community is that we’re all in it to socialise, share ideas, and grow as an industry. Try to talk to at least one new person at every event. Don’t just stick to the same group of friends: be sociable. You never know what might come of it.
* **Talk about work**: but don’t be pushy. People will usually ask “what do you do” or “where do you work” so take that opportunity to talk about dxw positively. Talk about the things you’re doing, what you’re finding interesting, and things relevant to the situation. Just don’t go on about yourself, ask people about their work and be interested in what they have to say.
* **If we’re hiring**: talk to even more people than normal! Especially if you’re at an event where the attendees might be relevant for the job. But again, don’t be pushy. Talk to people, join conversations, and if appropriate, mention that we’re hiring and they might be a good candidate. Just don’t let it be the only thing you talk about.

#### Speaking at events

Speaking at events is a great opportunity to represent dxw. There are a couple
of ways this can be valuable.

If it’s an event around your personal speciality (front-end development, sysops,
UX etc), feel free to stick to any personal “branding”, slides, or talk style
you might have already developed. At the start of your talk however, please
introduce yourself as being from dxw, introduce what the company does, and what
you do at the company. Then continue with your talk.

If it’s an event more around dxw’s focus (public sector events, dxw projects,
public-sector specific topic etc) then err more towards using dxw's branding and
slides. Introduce the company in full and what your role is within the company.
Stick to the dxw style of talk and where appropriate discuss the company’s
principles.

In either situation, if we’re hiring, mention this towards the end of the talk.
Tell people what roles we’re looking for and that they’re welcome to speak to
you after the talk about it in more detail. Also make sure to have a short link
to the job description in your slides too.

The most important thing to remember is that you'll leave the best impression -
personally and for the company - if your talk is interesting, useful and
well-presented. It takes time to make talks that work well. If you need help,
advice or time to prepare, don't be afraid to ask for it. It's also good to blog
after the event, to talk about your experience and what you learned. If you need
time to be set aside, talk to a delivery lead and see what's possible.

### Blog

At dxw, we all write blog posts regularly.

We blog because want to share what we're doing and what we're learning about
tech and government with the digital community. When we're hiring, we also want
potential new staff to be able to to get to know us a bit beforehand. Writing
introductory blog posts and following up with communicating about the work we do
helps people gauge what kind of team we are. We also work in the open and are
keen to share our knowledge, express our values and get people thinking about
how to improve services for the public sector. One of the ways we do this is by
encouraging feedback as much as honing our own views on certain topics.

We collect ideas for blog posts on a Trello board, where they can be discussed
before being written. Often, we'll pick up ideas from this board on Fridays and
spend our dxw time writing.

The process for writing a new post is:

* Write the post and save in Google Drive
* Have peers review your post and suggest changes (if required)
* When you're happy with the post, ask the Marketing team to sign it off
* Send the post to CommsCrowd to see if they might want to pitch it to publications
* When ready, add the post to WordPress as a draft and agree a publication time with the team
* Write a tweet to promote your post and add it to Buffer, scheduled to go out when the post is public
